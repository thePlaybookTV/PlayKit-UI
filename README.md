# PlayKit UI

 - We’ll be implementing this UI Kit using the atomic approach. i.e Build from atoms > Molecules > Elements. This means we’ll be designing the individual elements first, before designing the blocks then moving on to templates and full screens. 


- We can also go as far as creating theme related templates such as 
—Ecommerce
—Bot Design
—Video Streaming
—Social Sharing 
—Fintech & Digital Banking

We can distribute these across available hands for speed.

- Icon Design. 
~~The vision is to create our own custom icons but it remains up for debate. If the workload proves too much, we can ship with font-awesome and update with our local icon-pack later on~~
Custom Icons are definitely happening! Thanks to @Flox :) 


- Do we go as far as generating HTML/CSS/JS for this Kit as well as….wait for it… React Components? YES WE CAN!!!!!
